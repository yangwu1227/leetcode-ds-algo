    A road trip consists of `n + 1` points at different altitudes. The start point is `altitude = 0`. Given an integer array `gain` of 
    length `n` where `gain[i]` is the net gain in altitude between points `i` and `i + 1` for all (`0 <= i < n`), return the highest altitude of a point.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gain : Sequence[int]
        An integer array `gain` of length `n` where `gain[i]` is the net gain in altitude between points `i` and `i + 1` for all (`0 <= i < n`)
