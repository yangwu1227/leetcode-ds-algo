def find_average(nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    The k-radius average for a subarray of `nums` centered at index `i` with the radius `k` is the average of all elements in `nums` between the 
    indices `i - k` and `i + k` (inclusive). If there are less than `k` elements before or after the index `i`, then the k-radius average is `-1`.
    Build and return an array `avgs` of length `n` where `avgs[i]` is the k-radius average for the subarray centered at index `i`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nums : List[int]
        A list of integers
    k : int
        A non-negative integer

    Returns
    -------
    List[int]
        The list of k-radius averages for the subarrays centered at each index of `nums`
