def find_length(s: str) -> int:
    """
    Given a binary string s (a string containing only "0" and "1"). You may choose up to one "0" and flip it to a "1". Find the length of the longest substring
    achievable that contains only "1". Another way to look at this problem is to find the longest substring that contains at most one 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : str
        A binary string containing only "0" and "1".

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The length of the longest substring achievable that contains only "1".
