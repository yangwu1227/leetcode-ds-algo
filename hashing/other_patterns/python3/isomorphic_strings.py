def isomorphic(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    """
    Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

    Note: All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same
    character, but a character may map to itself.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : str
        A string containing valid ASCII characters
    t : str
        A string containing valid ASCII characters

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        `True` if `s` and `t` are isomophic, other wise `False`
