def visible_persons(heights: MutableSequence[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Calculate the number of people each person can see to their right in a queue.

    This function uses a monotonic stack approach to determine how many people
    each person in the queue can see to their right. A person can see another person
    to their right if all people between them are shorter than both of them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    heights : MutableSequence[int]
        A sequence of distinct integers where each integer represents the height of a person standing in a queue

    Returns
    -------
    List[int]
        A list of integers where the ith element represents the number of people the ith person can see to their right in the queue
